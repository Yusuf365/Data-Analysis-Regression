Deciphering the Temporal Patterns of
COVID-19: A Comprehensive Analysis of Case
Rates in England∗
Mohammed Yusuf Shaikh
March 17, 2024
The survey uncovers how the spread of COVID-19 in England has fluctuated
from year to year from 2020 to 2023. We determined a negative binomial regression
model and we tested the association between incidence rate (month and year) and
the (the overdispersion trait of the data) . Studies have show a marked decrease
in the numbers of cases over time this reflects the success of health promotion
programs and vaccination campaigns. Aside from that, although there was a slight
but noticeable change, there was also a correlate of monthly variations in case rates.
This study reinforces that the time changes in COVID-19 are an obstacle, and the
response has to be subject to constant public health monitoring and flexibility.
After designing a surveillance system, policymakers and public health authorities
can consequently leverage the lessons learnt first hand in informed planning for
future outbreaks. With in-depth analysis, we focus on the significance of the time
related to the transmission of infectious diseases and productivity of the field of
research by which time can play a role.
1 Introduction
COVID-19 pandemic is brought about by SARS-CoV-2 virus and first appeared in the end
of 2019, growing to be the world ‘s deadly virus in a very short time. Existing worldwide
healthcare systems, countries’ economies, and everyday life have experienced frequent disruptions
by this outbreak on the single hand, it drove the alarming need for better infectious
disease surveillance and management strategies. Of the lot of lessons that have been attained,
the know-how of the temporal dimension in the tranmission of diseases is currently the most
important aspect of the successful public health reaction.

Temporal analysis that captures disease indicators changes can’t be left out when there is
a need to appraise outbreak trends, forecast epidemics and assess the effectiveness of the
interventions. One example is, during COVID-19, these studies offered the introspect to the
extent public health actions, seasonal changes in transmission, and the implication of the
immunization campaigns do impact them. Notwithstanding the right amount of resources
invested in the research, the very complex temporal factors and the COVID-19 cases continue
to be studied because most interventions are made in the region where most of the options for
intervention and behavior, and environmental conditions are incomprehensible.
There is the case of England which has a diverse population and decentralized public health
service as well that makes it a unique objective to study these dynamics. During this pandemic
the county has seen the rise and fall of infection rates which were caused by national lockdown,
local tier system and vaccination roll out. These factors, along with the populations’ behavior
and the change of seasons, have resulted in the intricate networks of disease spread. It is
essential to notice such patterns to develop strategies for future public health and also mitigate
the consequences of the resurgence or new viral threats.
This study shall seek to elucidate the spatiotemporal trends of COVID-19 transmission in
England, by revealing how the case rates per 100,000 population have transmuted from 2020
to 2023. Through the use of a negative binomial regression model, we account for the overdispersion
that usually happens in infectious disease count data. With this, we present a more
sophisticated analysis on the relationship of time (month and year) with the COVID-19 case
rates. Implementation of this approach therefore makes it possible to track with precision the
seasonal trends and the efficacy of contextual public health interventions over time.
By doing this, we have an ambition of bringing more understanding about the chronological
characteristics of Covid-19 and helping to make informative decisions that can guide policy
making, public health planning and future research. This study, however, shows the importance
of temporal analysis in the ongoing struggle to manage the incidence of COVID-19
worldwide. It provides a foundation for combating infectious diseases with more effectiveness
and efficiency in the future.
2 Data
2.1 Source and Collection
The dataset this study is derived from are open data records from Leicester City Council
containing test data to the day, with 7-day rates per 100,000 for all England, covering the time
period from 2020 until now. These figures are based on the most recent population datasets
that have been published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the middle of the year
of 2019, thus making possible to perform comparative analysis across various periods of time.
This unprecedented dataset allows for the identification of COVID-19’s pattern of transmission
2
throughout England over time, which can then reveal what impact certain factors have had
on the spread of the virus at various stages.
Data used in this paper was downloaded from ’(Data 2023) , cleaned and analyzed with the
programming language R (R Core Team 2022). Also with support of additional packages in R:
tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019), janitor (Firke 2021), dplyr (Wickham et al. 2022), readr
(Wickham, Hester, and Bryan 2024), (Ripley et al. 2023), (Gabry et al. 2023), (Robinson and
Hayes 2022), (Arel-Bundock 2023) .
2.2 Variables
The dataset comprises several key variables critical for the analysis:The dataset comprises
several key variables critical for the analysis:
Date: The study was conducted from Jan 1 2020 to Dec 31 2023 with the data of interest.
This time of variable is of great importance for the consonance of temporal analysis and is
additional developed into year, month and day components in order to be clearer and more
detailed. AreaName: Finds the place of this study like England only. The geographical
situation will be the constant assessment theme. NewCasesBySpecimenDate: The amount
of new infection cases appear in the report of specimen date. This gradable idea acting as
a measure of virus’s advance. NewCasesRatePer100k: The rate of new cases (per 100,000
population) and standardized using ONS 2019 intermediate as a measure. This pace in like
manner creates the basis for making comparisons over different time periods and populations.
NewCasesRollingSum: A running total representing the new cases which offers a trending
indicator which presents a smooth metric that can be used to show trends over a specific time
period.
2.3 Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis, several preprocessing steps were undertaken:To prepare
the dataset for analysis, several preprocessing steps were undertaken:
Cleaning: In the dataset, the values that were wrong were, such as missing items or inaccurate
entries, were checked for any inconsistencies. Because the outcome of the analysis can have
profound implications, accurate data was absolutely necessary. Transformation: Date variable
was disaggregated to year, month, and day components so that a cross-sectional time analysis
could be done. This process lets switch from seasonal observation to daily activity recording
directly seeing the impact of an event or activity on a given day. Normalization: Rates were
calculated per 100,000 people into population to provide comparisons over time and across
different population sizes. That data was standardized. Aggregation: Different data types
were sometimes added to monthly or yearly scales to discover wide-ranging trends and sort
out any noise found in the daily records.

Figure 1: Distribution of New COVID-19 Cases Rate per 100k in England
The histogram plotted in Figure 1 is the distribution of New Cases Rate per 100k in the England
region, from the year 2020 to 2023. The x axis symbolizes the new case rate per 100,000
population and y-axis signifies the frequency of these rates within the dataset. Graphically
shown, the data is right-skewed implying most data is at the lower end of the spectrum. Many
of the peaks are high and separated by long tails to the right showing high rates of transmission.
A significant component of the pandemic waves, including the sporadic outbreaks and possible
superspreader events, which underlie the highly episodic nature of the infectious disease, can
be seen here. The shape of the distribution is emblematic of the need for a statistical model
that incorporates such overdispersion — where the variation is larger than the mean — because
such modeling has innumerable implications on the kind of model to be chosen.
The total number of records in the dataset and the range of dates covered indicated the comprehensive
nature of the data, capturing the entirety of the pandemic’s progression in England
up to 2023. Summary statistics for NewCasesBySpecimenDate, NewCasesRatePer100k, and
NewCasesRollingSum highlighted the variability in COVID-19 transmission rates over time,
reflecting waves of infection and periods of relative calm. As the distribution of NewCases-
RatePer100k revealed a right-skewed pattern, indicative of periods with exceptionally high
transmission rates contrasted against more typical levels of new cases. Temporal trends were
visualized through time series plots, illustrating the impact of national lockdowns, vaccination
rollouts, and other public health measures on COVID-19 transmission rates.

3.1 Model Setup
One main purpose of our model is to review the periods of COVID-19 cases per 100,000
population in England, considering how the data changed from 2020 to 2023 and whether it
is linked to the seasons in particular. Through analysis of time (conveyed through months
and years) and COVID-19 transmission we are endeavoring to expose the networks of how the
pandemic gets changed when different public health measures and societal situations have an
impact. Taking into account the observation being independent variable namely COIVD—19
cases per 100,000 population, which is a count of occurrences within a specified population size
and time period, the generalized linear model (GML) framework can be applied. Variation
becomes the main issue when it comes to the choice between Poisson and negative binomial
GLMs. The regulation of count data depends on the distribution and variance of the count
data. Originally, the Poisson regression applied were the uncomplicated one which assumed
that the mean and variance of the distribution were the same. Nevertheless, this assumption
fails to hold in the analysis of the real data especially in large counts like the COVID-19 case
rates, where the process is often overdispersed (variance exceeds the mean). To deal with the
phenomenon of overdispersion, we identified negative binomial regression model as the most
appropriate. This model echoes the Poisson model but has an inherent feature that increases
the likelihood of extra variation occurring. This model should become a basis for the data
we have as the variance exceeds the mean by a large margin. This negative binomial model,
therefore, is more flexible and precise, having been able to accommodate the observed high
level of variability observed on various time periods.
3.2 Model Specification
The model is specified as follows:
NewCasesRatePer100k ∼ NegativeBinomial(𝜇, 𝜃)
The parameters 𝜇 is the mean number of cases per 100,000 population, modeled as a function
of time (month and year). 𝜃 is the dispersion parameter, accounting for overdispersion in the
data.
The relationship between the mean of the dependent variable and the independent variables
(month and year) is expressed through a log link function:
We use a log-linear model for the mean number of cases 𝜇:
log(𝜇) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1(month) + 𝛽2(year)
5
Where:
• 𝛽0 is the intercept, representing the log of expected case rate when month and year are
zero (baseline level).
• 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 are coefficients representing the effect of each month and year on the log of
the case rate, respectively.
The negative binomial regression model is justified based on empirical evidence. At first, the
overdispersion was present in the case rates data which can be explained by Poisson model
inadequacy.The simple Poisson model does not account for all variable factors in infectious
disease transmission.
3.3 Assumptions and Limitations
The negative binomial model is more suitable of our data than other count models, with some
assumptions and restrictions however. These factors encompass the assumption of mutual
independence of observations and omitted heterogeneity affecting infections rates. Further on,
the model lacks an explanation of the spatial variability or non-time covariates which could
inspire future studies

The Table 1 was applied in order to investigate the association between time (measured in
months and years) and the New Cases Rate per 100k with a Negative Binomial regression
model. As mentioned, the summary model will give the regression estimates their standard
errors, z-values, and the p-values.
The model features an intercept and coefficients for month and year. The estimate for the
intercept was above zero, suggesting the baseline new case rate per 100k was highest at the
reference time. The month as well as the year indicators were negative and highly significant
(p < 0.001), which implies that the new case rate statistically significantly falls down as time
changes forward. A negative sign for the month suggests that new case rates decrease slightly
with each passing month. On the other hand, the year sign is clearly more significant and refers
6
to the drastic impact of various means and the way pandemic situations evolve. The Negative
Binomial model evaluated with an estimated value for its dispersion parameter 𝜃 equal to
0.6998 and standard error of 0.0163 demonstrated overdispersion in the count data correlated
to what could have been expected under a Poisson model. This illuminates the reason of
choosing this Negative Binomial model. Concerning model fit, the residual deviance (3287.1)
on 2741 degrees of freedom indicates that the model is adequate where it has been specified
appropriately. The AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) value of the model is 33351. Having
smaller values of AIC than the Null model which only consists of the intercept terms (no
predictors) proposed that incorporating month and year as predictors, provide a meaningfully
better fit to the data.
Hence, the findings indicate a clear and consistent temporal trend in the rate of new COVID-
19 cases in England. This aligns with what would be expected given the introduction of
public health measures, the seasonal impact on virus transmission, and the progression towards
widespread vaccination over the years studied. The significant p-values for both time predictors
reiterate their importance in explaining the variability in new case rates.

Residuals plot is a very powerful tool for validating the model of regression with respect to
the fitting. In Figure 2: shows the negative binomial model residuals plotted versus fitted
values. In an ideal case, the residuals should randomly deviate around the horizontal line at
zero, which shows that the model unbiasedly predicts the predicted values regardless of their
size.
Consistently, Figure 2, we find that the residuals are clustered close to the central vertical line,
which is regarded as a good representation of the model behavior. Yet there are definitive
7
patterns which take the shape of different vertical lines. These are probably due to the noise
in discretize data as well as the deficit of the case between what the model predicted and the
existed days.

This line chart from Figure 3 represents the expected number of new COVID-19 cases per
100,000 population, which is a product of not only the months but also the years, according to
our negative binomial regression model. According to this paragraph, every year is a separate
line.
It is evident that new cases rate per 100k persons are decreasing as we get months that are
far from January. The persisting downward trend might mean that seasonality, public health
interventions, and/or natural course of the pandemic, including the effects of vaccination, are
to blame for the falling rates of current cases. Steepest decline is clearly seen in year 2020,
displayed by the line. This could be attributed to the initial high incidence followed by a sharp
decrease most probably reflecting the implementation of early and harsh lockdown restrictions
purposed to handle the progress of the disease. The next years—2021 in (green line), 2022
in (blue line), and 2023 in (purple line) do not show the drastic decline in the estimated
percentages. Such flattening may stand for the good progress towards virus bio neutralization
accomplished by the ongoing public health measures, the development of herd immunity, or
the effect of vaccination programs. It is worth pointing out that the forecast rates in 2023 are
considerably lower than the actual rates in 2020 with a substantial decrease in the number of
new cases over the years implying a good vaccine and therapy for the COVID-19 treatment
that is getting more and more effective. The model seems to depict the deceleration of the
8
COVID-19 cases, being so as to identify the strategies used. Nevertheless, further studies are
required in order to check if the applied interventions and other conditions could impact on
the effectiveness eventually.

predicted rate as the amplification of predicted case rate indicates that the model underestimated
in higher transmission times. The graph shows clearly that the model is in good shape
for minor case surges but more factors still have to be taken into considerations in order to
improve the predictions concerning case rates at the higher end of the spectrum.
5 Discussion
This study presents an article that comprises of the seasonal pattern, strategic plans, and the
trajectory of the COVID-19 case rate decline in England as reflected in the substantial drop
of the number of cases over time. The negative binomial regression model, which we selected
because it can address over dispersion, exemplified a drop every month and a year in the new
cases number per 100,000 of population. The lower transmission rate is predicted in the Model
which is seen in Figure 3, however peak periods are forecasts less accurately in the model. This
can as well illustrate the effects of other unexpected things happened, say a more contagious
9
subtype appeared or the shifting behaviors of people, that are not linked with the general flow
of time only.
The model model’s strong point is its ability to forecast with a high degree of accuracy cases
that are not as highly transmitable as the initial ones. Following the provision of this purpose is
to help healthcare systems and policymakers in the task of allocating resources to operations
in normal, routine times. Besides the close correlation with the downward trend in case
incidence, the above pattern appears as a big picture of short- and long-term implementation
of the public health interventions and vaccination drive. An overlook of case rates at high
prevalence points remains among the things that the researchers should not disregard. Their
argument is subject to criticism. The missing factors in variables such as disruption of public
health policy changes, population following the designs to the letter may also be an explain
the gap. Besides, the presumption that the given month and year are standard units of time
without any considerations for their interdependence may draw some simplistic real-world
complexity of pandemic progress. This article is the beginning of many others which hopefully
will encourage further exploration of the causal link between poverty and underachievement.
Building upon the existing variables with additional ones such as mobility data or public health
policies or even vastly different virus strains might be useful as long as it increases the model’s
predictive power. The intra-monthly patterns or the impact of social get-togethers on the level
of happiness could also throw more detailed information about the global scenario.
6 Conclusion
Our study has gone into a trend analysis of COVID-19 cases in England, using a negative
binomial regression model to determine at what rate the cases have changed monthly and
yearly over the period 2020 to 2023. The trend-line showed the changes in the number of
cases increasing gradually which may be a result of the changes in the season, public health
intervention methods and the development of the community immunity level over a period of
time.
When the model was tested, it proved its strength for predicting flat transmission, which is the
foundation of the process of planning and managing of healthcare. Yet, it showed less accuracy
in anticipating the high transmission rate since there was lack of interactivity between some of
the factors that can lead to pandemic. This underlines the need to consider other modelling
variables in the future besides public health policy, cultural behaviors and viral properties to
factor in their multilayered impact on the pandemic spread.
The model has its limitations, but it is often helpful for about what will happen during the
epidemic and in the context of planning to prevent disease outbreaks. The paper stresses the
relevance of new discoveries and regular data assessment. This will enable the development of
practical guidelines, especially where new variations emerge or the behaviors of other people
change.
10
In general, when the world is striving to conquer the contagiousness of the coronavirus, it
is obvious that the evidence-based, meticulous and comprehensive modelling techniques are
imperative. These methods both give us the information of previous situations in history and
prepare us for future epidemics also. The studies that we carry out are part of a team effort
that strives to find answers to the current Covid 19 problem. In turn, these facts reveal the
need for a modified and comprehensive reaction to this extraordinary global health crisis.
